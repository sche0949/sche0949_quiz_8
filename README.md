**Description**

There are the imaging techniques of artworks that I chose to inspire me. You can see that these three images are mainly based on irregular random lines (random but with overall layout control) and shapes (different sizes and thicknesses), and cleverly use color matching such as contrasting colors and gradient colors, which can convey some emotions. Since we need to choose a certain artwork to express in the major project, and these artworks need to be interpreted through rich colors and lines, I think the elements I mentioned in the inspiration image are very suitable for inclusion in my project.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

**Description**

The coding technology I found to help achieve the imaging technology selected in Part 1 is Random Walker. Since the images of Part 1 are mainly random lines and shapes, I think is quite suitable. We can control the thickness and color of different lines, and each frame of these lines moves in a random direction. Therefore, I think the color matching is important, and the collision between the thickness of the lines. After determining the color, set the main color theme for the artwork, and use it as the background, then create other controllable elements, will produce interesting work.
