There are the imaging techniques of artworks that I chose to inspire me. You can see that these three images are mainly based on irregular random lines (random but with overall layout control) and shapes (different sizes and thicknesses), and cleverly use color matching such as contrasting colors and gradient colors, which can convey some emotions. Since we need to choose a certain artwork to express in the major project, and these artworks need to be interpreted through rich colors and lines, I think the elements I mentioned in the inspiration image are very suitable for inclusion in my project.
